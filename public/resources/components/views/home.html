    <p class="splash-subhead">AlphaWell offer end-to-end cloud based reservoir optimization platform for Oil and Gas companies
      to maximize reservoir Net Present Value (NPV).
      The solution leverages modern machine learning algorithm to provide a pure data-driven approach.
      The analytics platform is built with mathematical models as the core of the data-driven approach
      while providing Human-centric user interface to assist reservoir engineer and field operation personnel. </p>

      <p>
        Modern reservoir simulation has been playing more and more important role in oil production.
        However, the modeling is becoming more and more complicated due to more physics involved and more parameters to be provided.
        Computational limitations - inability to run large numbers of simulations
        Lack of adequate historical data to calibrate reservoir models
        Large uncertainty in physical properties,Â 
        Unpredictable oil and gas prices
        Most of the current data-driven software are still traditional deliverable model and less user friendly
